# Todo List Application

Welcome to the To-Do List GraphQL API! This project is a serverless application that allows users to manage their to-do lists. The backend is built with MongoDB for data storage, AWS Lambda for function execution, and AWS API Gateway to expose the GraphQL endpoint. This README provides an overview of the project, setup instructions, and key details to get you started.

## Technologies Used

- MongoDB: NoSQL database for data storage.
- GraphQL: Data query language for API communication.
- AWS Lambda: Serverless computing to execute the GraphQL resolvers.
- AWS API Gateway: Exposes the GraphQL endpoint to the outside world.

## Improvements
